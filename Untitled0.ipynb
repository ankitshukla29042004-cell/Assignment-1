        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is popular because it is easy to learn, versatile, has a large library of modules, works across platforms, and has strong community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, converting it into machine code so the computer can run it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have a special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (like variable or function names). Examples include `if`, `for`, `while`, `class`, and `def`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved by the language to define its syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed after it is created. Mutable objects (like lists, dictionaries, and sets) can be modified, while immutable objects (like strings, tuples, and integers) cannot be changed once created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Lists are mutable because their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation, while tuples are immutable because Python stores them in a fixed memory structure to ensure they cannot be altered once created.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, == checks whether the values of two objects are equal, while is checks whether both objects refer to the same memory location (i.e., the same object).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements. They are:\n",
        "\n",
        "     `and` – Returns `True` if both conditions are true.\n",
        "     `or` – Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "     `not` – Returns `True` if the condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Type casting in Python is the process of converting a value from one data type to another, such as from an integer to a string or from a string to a float, using functions like `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit type casting (type conversion) is done automatically by Python when it converts one data type to another without losing information.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   - The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to execute specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are true, allowing decision-making in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   - The elif statement in Python checks another condition if the previous if or elif condition was false. It allows multiple conditions to be tested one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "   - A for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance (iterating over a sequence like a list, string, or range).\n",
        "\n",
        "     A while loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true, and the number of iterations is not fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know in advance how many times you need to repeat the code, and the loop should continue until a certain condition changes.\n",
